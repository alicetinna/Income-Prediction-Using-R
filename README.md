# Income-Prediction-Using-R

This goal of this use case study is to create a predictive model to predict income category of over or under 50K $ based on various factors. Data has been taken from 1994 Census database provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository. So, after analyzing the data set, it is explored and cleaned by removing non-required values, which is being further used in different methods of modeling viz. Decision tree, Random forest, and Logistic analysis. Further performance is observed using confusion matrix and ROC with the help of Area under curve. Finally, according to the modelling it is been observed that Logistic Regression is the most suitable model. At last for further work, we intend to improve with different values associated with Random Forests. We would also like to try different pruning methods with Decision Trees and attempt other models as well. Finally, we would like to attempt this whole project with the full dataset which are 32560 observations instead of using 5000 observations.
